# OptiSort: Monosilicon Optical Sorting Technology

Welcome to the **OptiSort** GitHub repository! This project focuses on developing an automatic optical sorting station specifically designed for sorting monosilicon fragments.

## Project Overview

**OptiSort** aims to revolutionize the sorting process for monosilicon by leveraging advanced optical technologies. This system is designed to automatically identify and sort monosilicon based on specific criteria such as size, shape and morhpology. The goal is to enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and improve the overall quality of sorted monosilicon fragments.

## Features

- **Automatic Sorting**: Fully automated system that requires minimal human intervention.
- **Optical Detection**: Utilizes high-resolution cameras and sensors to accurately identify monosilicon characteristics.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing and sorting materials in real-time, ensuring high throughput.
- **Customizable Criteria**: Allows for the customization of sorting parameters to meet specific requirements.
- **Data Logging**: Records sorting data for analysis and optimization.

## Installation

To install and run the OptiSort system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/d-galli/opti-sort.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd OptiSort
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your camera and sensor systems are properly connected.
2. Configure the sorting criteria in the `config.json` file.
3. Start the system using the provided command.
4. Monitor the sorting process through the user interface or command line output.
