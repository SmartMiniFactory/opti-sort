# OptiSort: Optical Sorting Cell

Welcome to the **OptiSort** GitHub repository! This project focuses on developing an automatic optical sorting station designed for sorting of small and tiny objects, i.e. monosilicon fragments.
It's a projcet developed at the Smart Mini Factory lab of the Free University of Bozen/Bolzano (Italy).

## Project Overview

**OptiSort** aims to revolutionize the sorting process for monosilicon by leveraging advanced optical technologies. This system is designed to automatically identify and sort momnosilicon fragments based on specific criteria such as size, shape and morhpology. The goal is to enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and improve the overall quality of sorted monosilicon fragments.

## Features

- **Automatic Sorting**: Fully automated system that requires minimal human intervention.
- **Optical Detection**: Utilizes high-resolution cameras and sensors to accurately identify monosilicon characteristics.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing and sorting materials in real-time, ensuring high throughput.
- **Customizable Criteria**: Allows for the customization of sorting parameters to meet specific requirements.
- **Data Logging**: Records sorting data for analysis and optimization.

## Installation

To install and run the OptiSort system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/d-galli/opti-sort.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd OptiSort
    ```
